        <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2> 
        <p>Over the years, I have engaged in many different activities,
          whether it be with friends or solo. However, some of my favorite
          things to do are the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Photography</li>
          <li>Traveling</li>
          <li>Driving</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Photography has been something I was really interested in learning after seeing
          so many cool photos online especially after Instagram became popular.
          I recently purchased a DSLR camera and am always looking for an opportunity
          to take it out and shoot. My next big purchase will be a video drone that I can
          take on my next travel destination.
        </p>
        <p>
          Traveling has been a big part of my goals recently, after I realized time isn't
          waiting for anyone. Every year I plan to travel to at least one international destination
          with family and friends. A life goal of mine is to travel to every country across the globe
          at least once.

        <p>
          Driving is incredibly fun to me, in contrast to a lot of you I'm sure.
          I see driving as a way to de-stress and let my mind go where it wants.
          I also just enjoy the aspect of controlling a vehicle to transport me somewhere.
          This definitely must have influenced my mechanical background.
